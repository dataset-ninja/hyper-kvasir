**HyperKvasir: The Largest Gastrointestinal Dataset (Segmentation Part)** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the medical industry. 

The dataset consists of 1000 images with 2135 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *polyp* and *polyp_bbox*.

Images in the HyperKvasir Segmentation dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation and bounding box annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation task (only one mask for every class). All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the datasetThe dataset was released in 2020 by the NO-SW-AU joint research group.

Here is the visualized example grid with animated annotations:
